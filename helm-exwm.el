;;; Commentary:
;; `helm-exwm' run a Helm session over the list of EXWM buffers.
;;
;; To separate EXWM buffers from Emacs buffers in `helm-mini', set up the sources as follows:
;;
;;   (setq helm-exwm-emacs-buffers-source (helm-exwm-build-emacs-buffers-source))
;;   (setq helm-exwm-source (helm-exwm-build-source))
;;   (setq helm-mini-default-sources `(helm-exwm-emacs-buffers-source
;;                                     helm-exwm-source
;;                                     helm-source-recentf)
;;
;; `helm-exwm-switch' is a convenience X application launcher using Helm to
;; switch between the various windows of one or several specific applications.
;; See `helm-exwm-switch-browser' for an example.

;;; Bugs:
;; TODO: kill-persistent is not persistent.
;; This is a Helm issue.  See
;; https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/1914
;;
;; TODO: Message when killing some buffers: "Killed 0 buffer(s)".
;; See https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/issues/322.
;; A workaround would be to discard the result of kill-buffer and print the
;; count manually.

;;; Code:
